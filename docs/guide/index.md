# Vince Analytics

## Introduction

`Vince Analytics` is an  open source cloud native web analytics platform. It allows
you to collect website stats while respecting your visitors privacy.


## Why Vince ?

I was looking for a self hosted web analytics solution that offered these features

- Alert notification
- Time on site tracking
- Conversion tracking 
- Multiple site management
- User Interaction Management 
- Campaign Management 
- Report Generation
- Goal Tracking 
- Event Tracking 
- Cloud Native ( Works well with k8s)
- Backup and Restore

I failed to find one which was easy to use/manage and that was specifically designed
for self hosting. Most solution out there are geared towards cloud offering and 
self hosting comes as a bonus.

Vince was designed from grounds up to be a cloud citizen and a painless self hosted
solution for web analytics ,catering for teams of all sizes.

With ease of use as a self hosted solution, vince comes as a single binary with
everything you need for production deployments. There is zero runtime dependency.


# The name vince 

Vince is named after [Vince Staples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Staples) , 
my favorite hip hop artist.

It was late night, 1 year after I quit my job and took a sabbatical, I was listening
to one of his album [Big Fish Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fish_Theory)
. The song Big Fish inspired me to program again.

The lyrics that got me going.
```
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
```

So, enjoy the outcome of my late nights, hoping to be counting hundreds by the thousand
soon.
